A planet is a large astronomical body that is not a star or stellar remnant. There are competing scientific definitions of a 'planet'. In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union, a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects. The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition. In the geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite. In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons. Bodies meeting the geological definition are sometimes called "planetary-mass objects" or "planemos" for short.
